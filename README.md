# AI-Based Early Detection of Hygiene Risk Patterns in Senior Care 
## Summary

In senior care facilities, hygiene-related risks (such as infection outbreaks or recurring hygiene deviations) are often detected too late. Although documentation data exists, staff usually lack the time and analytical tools to systematically detect patterns.

## Problem

This project proposes a machine learning system that analyzes structured facility data to identify early warning signs of hygiene risks.

The system would analyze:

- Incident reports  
- Hygiene audit findings  
- Temperature logs  
- Documentation frequency and irregularities  
- Infection records  

Using classification and anomaly detection models, the system would:

- Detect recurring hygiene deviations  
- Identify risk clusters within specific units  
- Generate a risk score for early intervention  

## Data

The system would use anonymized structured data including:

- Date  
- Unit  
- Type of incident  
- Risk category  
- Severity level  

All resident-related data would be anonymized.

## Method

- Supervised learning classification model  
- Pattern detection  
- Risk scoring model  

## Expected Impact

- Earlier detection of infection outbreaks  
- Improved hygiene management  
- Data-driven leadership decisions  
- Better preparation for external audits  

## Ethical Considerations

- Full GDPR compliance  
- No individual performance tracking  
- Transparent algorithm logic  
- Strict anonymization of sensitive data
